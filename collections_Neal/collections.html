<p class="filmInfo" id="ITAKM_text"> In this photography concept, I intend to show a black person's evolving intersections and identity throughout their lifetime. They'll walk on this field as a boy, a woman, and then a traveler, learning, growing, and healing. The first character the audience will see is a young boy who's been subconsciously conditioned not to love himself; there's a massive open wound on his chest, marking where his heart was. He carries that "heart" in his cape on his back. It's been formed to his environment, painted white, bruised, and vulnerable. As she travels, her heart changes along with the vessel. The wound is still there, except his cape and pants are now her skirts. Her spirits are no longer powdered, although still burdened. There's a looming fear of disconnection from the earth, and her heart yearns to be free. This happens as they eventually ascend. On their final day, it can be said that their wounds had healed, returning to the earth as peacefully as they came. </p>
