<p class="filmInfo" id="SIA_text"> "Summer in America" is featured in this year's Queens Underground Black and Brown Film festival in Jamaica, NY. In the weeks that I shot this film, it had been both the scariest and most invigorating moments of life. Part of the film captures the celebration of Juneteenth, while the other captures the 50 mm march to Madison. I remember the festival like it was yesterday. I was highly cross-faded by the time the march was over, and the activities had started, but I remembered the goal I had unquestionably. I wanted to capture the resiliency of black people, our love, our laughter, yall rhythm, our expression, etc. I wanted to create a comfortable space for us to exist without our trauma and injustice's glorifications. We as people should not only be highlighted/supported in response to the publicized violence done to us. We should be celebrated and supported for the amount of light and beauty we give to the world. While walking with 50 mm, there was a lot of passion and beautiful emotions, but there was also a lot of violence and hate thrown at us for merely existing. However, I didn't/ don't feel the need to show that because we already know it exists. Instead, I hope that when all of my black and brown comrades see this film, they can relax and rejoice because they see us with a happy ending.</p>
